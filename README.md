# Tridiagonal matrix equation
Tridiagonal matrix equation is one very useful equation for numerical simulation, where the implicit finite difference is applied to solve PDE. This repository is to go through different implementations of the TDMA algorithms and try to figure out the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms.

## Accuracy test on the CPU implementation
The single-precision and double-precision float number are used to store the coefficients of the tridiagonal test. Then the tridiagonal matrix algorithm will be used to solve the equation. Two implementations of the TDMA are presented here, i.e., Wiki and mine.

## Efficiency and accuracy of the Tridiagonal matrix equation solved by Parallel Cyclic Reduction

A traditional TDMA algorithm is implemented in order to compare with the current PCR tridiagonal solver.

The test environment is `2 vCPU 8 GB, GPUï¼šNvidia Tesla P4`. The two algorithms are applied to solve a linear equation `Ax=d`, where `A` is a diagonal dominant matrix. The matrix `A` and the right hand side are both generated randomly. The two algorithms will run repeatedly, and the statistics about the elapsed time will be used as the measurement of the efficiency. Meanwhile, comparison between the calculated results are made directly as a measurement of the accuracy.

Here comes the results,

```

It might be found that as the size of the diagonal matrix increases, the efficiency of the one with GPU implementation goes above that with CPU version. But it seems that the deviation between the two algorithms are not negligible. The detail implementation should be checked for both the algorithms.
